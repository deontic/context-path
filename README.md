# context-path

 used to add folders to the PATH variable through the context menu (only works on Windows right now)
it serves as a convenient, lightweight (~25 KB) utility to add folders to the PATH variable through the context menu (you don't need to open the System Properties window as you normally would)

you must close *all* terminal instances or find a way to refresh PATH before using the newly added directory 
in the gif above I closed the only open terminal and opened a new one, and then file.bat was accessible
